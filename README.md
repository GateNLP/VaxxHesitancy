# VaxxHesitancy

Paper accepted @ICWSM 2023 https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/22213/21992

We create a publicly available dataset of over 3,100 COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets labelled as one of four stance categories: pro-vaxx, anti-vaxx, vaxx-hesitant, or irrelevant.

We split our dataset into two separate files:

(1) VaccineHesitancy_train_v2.csv (Single + Double annotated)

(2) VaccineHesitancy_test.csv (Double annotated)

Our dataset is publicly available via Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/7601328

Our PLM (i.e., covid-vaccine-twitter-bert) is available via HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/GateNLP/covid-vaccine-twitter-bert
